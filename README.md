FIRST, TURN YOUR VOLUME DOWN TO LIKE 10% OR LESS, SO IT IS ON THE LOWEST SETTING!!!!!!!!!

python 7_autothresh.py
```

**I MEAN IT, TURN YOUR VOLUME DOWN BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM**

Commands:
- moving mouse: where the sensor is located. doesn't go off the edge of the screen, so you have to stay within like 80px of the edge.
- F: freeze the sensor where the mouse is at, so you can do other things with your mouse.
- M: swap to "movement only" or "normal", where in movement only, it shows the changes in pixel value, rather than raw pixel value.
- Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4: adjust the threshold values (relative brightness, lower and upper cutoff, etc.)
- Number 5: Set the threshold automatically based on what is currently in the screening area.
- J / K / L: send midi notes for MaxMSP project
